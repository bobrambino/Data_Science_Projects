# DHS Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of three different Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) datasets for the year 2010, 2015, and 2020. The project involves importing the datasets, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and creating visualizations to gain insights into various demographic and health-related indicators of Pregnancy Anemia.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Datasets

The project utilizes three DHS datasets:

1. **DHS RWANDA 2010**: https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/4
2. **DHS RWANDA 2015**: https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/68
3. **DHS RWANDA 2020**: https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog/98

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis is performed using Python programming language and various libraries including:

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and documentation.

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Import**: The datasets are imported into Pandas DataFrames for further analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Basic statistics, data summaries, and distributions are explored to understand the data structure and identify patterns.
3. **Visualization**: Various types of visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps are created to visualize relationships and trends within the data.
4. **Insights and Conclusions**: Based on the analysis and visualizations, key insights and conclusions are drawn regarding demographic and health indicators.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks and follow along with the analysis steps.

## Visualizations

Visualizations generated from the analysis are generated along the analysis. These visualizations provide insights into demographic and health-related indicators of Pregnancy Anemia across the three DHS datasets.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of importing, analyzing, and visualizing data from multiple DHS datasets. The insights gained from the analysis contribute to a better understanding of demographic and health trends in Pregnancy Anemia.
